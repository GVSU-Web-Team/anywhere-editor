# Anywhere Editor
Anywhere editor is just that - a portable WYSIWYG content editor, designed to be flexible enough you can you use it anywhere. With a single React Component you can add a fully featured content editor to your project.

---

## Key features:
- **JSON in and JSON out** - It doesn't matter what your system looks like or what it runs on, as long as it can process JSON, you can use the editor. Content is stored as structured JSON not HTML, with the end display up to whatever you want to use to display it.

- **Block Based** - Start out with all the common content blocks you will need, or limit it to just text and headings, or write your own to extend it. Did I mention the goal is to make it flexible enough to use anywhere?

- **Extendable** - The editor is extendible so you can add your own content chunks with whatever properties you want to be available. 

- **Your Styles** - A WYSIWYG editor only works if what you see when editing actually looks like your end result. To accomplish that the goal is for every CSS class, layout option, and style to be customizable via the configuration. This makes it easy to integrate into projects regardless of their CSS framework.

## History/Development

This project started as a part of a project I worked on at GVSU, and I thought it might be useful to someone else. They agreed to open source it, so here it is! It's still in it's early stages but I wanted to get it out there for feedback, expect lots of updates soon!
